## What is OKR?

OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results.

OKR is a method of defining objectives and tracking their outcomes:

  * The Objective: what we want to achieve
  * The Key Results: how do we know we are getting there

To create an OKR, use this one sentence:

  * I will (Objective) as measured by (this set of Key Results).

Purpose:

  * OKR connects objectives of organizations, teams, and individuals.

  * OKR connects objectives to measurable results, making people move together in the right direction.

  * OKR makes sure everyone understands what's expected of them at work.

History:

  * OKR was invented at Intel and championed by Andy Grove, Intel CEO.

  * OKR is in use by many companies, including Intel, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and Uber.

Ground rules:

  * OKR items are visible to the whole organization, by default.

  * OKR visbility helps teams work together, and helps everyone know what others are doing.

## What is an objective?

Your objective should be:

* Inspirational

  * Provide a sense of meaning and progress.

  * Skip anything such as a small percentage gain.

* Relatable

  * Use language that your team knows and likes.

  * Skip abstract language and unfamiliar acronyms.

* Timely

  * Aim for a clear sprint toward a goal, such as doable this month, or doable this quarter.

  * If it takes a year, your objective may be strategy, or maybe even a mission.

* Actionable by the team independently

  * Your objective has to be truly yours

  * You can’t have any excuse of interdependence, such as "marketing didn’t market it."

* Measurable by the team independently

  * You have know if you've succeeded, or it you're making progress, and how much.

  * You can't have any excuse of independence, such as "That other team didn't measure it."



For example, some good objectives:

  * Launch an Awesome MVP.

  * Succeed in raising Series A investment.

  * Transform San Francisco’s shopping habits.

For example, some good key results:

  * Sales numbers up 30%.

  * Raise a Series A investment of $1MM.

  * Double our userbase.


All high-performance OKR systems have these commonalities:

* The ability to track results on a quantitative basis.

  * Key results are not general or subjective actions you plan to take.

  * They should always include numbers to make it clear how much has been achieved.

  * For example, if Mary’s objective is to improve her sales prospecting skills, one key result might be to spend two hours a week shadowing Jennifer, the team member who demonstrates the most prospecting success.

* Make it something people look at, every quarter, every week, every day.

  * This consistency turns goal-setting into a habit and changes how people think about their work and approach their everyday to-dos.

  * It puts in place natural milestones that make you think about what you need to do next and aim high.

* They have to be a stretch.

  * You want your objectives to be ambitious enough to push you beyond your limits.

  * When everyone does this, it forces the tough conversations about what's truly needed to beat expectations.

  * Most people wouldn’t consider 70% to be a good grade, but for OKRs that’s just about perfect, Davis says.


## What is a key result?

Key results take the inspirational language and quantify it.

Create key results by asking a simple question “how would we know if we met our objective?”

Typically you have 1-3 key results.

Metrics can be based on:

  * Growth
  * Engagement
  * Revenue
  * Performance
  * Quality

For example, “Launch an Awesome MVP” might have KR’s of:

  * Net Promotor Score (NPS) of 8/10
  * 20% of users come back 2X in one week
  * 10% conversion


## OKR quotations


### OKR quotations by Andy Grove, Intel CEO

Andy Grove, Intel CEO, first spoke about “Objectives and Key Results” (OKR) in his book High Output Management.

"A successful system needs only to answer two questions: Where do I want to go? The answer provides the Objective. How will I pace myself to see if I’m getting there? The answer gives us Key Results."

“The one thing OKR provides par excellence is focus.”

“We see a nesting hierarchy of Objectives: if the subordinate’s Objectives are met, the supervisor’s Objectives will be met as well.”

“To be useful a Key Result must contain very specific wording and dates, so that when the deadline time arrives, there is no room for ambiguity.”

“OKR is meant to pace a person – to put a stopwatch in his own hand so he can gauge his own performance. It is not a legal document upon which to base a performance review, but should be just one input used to determine how well an individual is doing. If the supervisor mechanically relies on the MBO system to evaluate his subordinate’s performance, or if the subordinate uses it rigidly and forgoes taking advantage of an emerging opportunity because it was not a specified Objective or Key Result, then both are behaving in a petty and unprofessional fashion.”


### OKR quotations by John Doerr

John Doerr, famous venture capitalist, wrote the book "Measure What Matters" to teach OKRs and why they help companies succeed.

"Objectives and key results are clear vessels for leaders’ priorities and insights."

"By clearing the line of sight to everyone’s objectives, OKRs save time and money."

"Transparency seeds collaboration."

"Continuous recognition is a powerful driver of engagement."

"Nothing moves us forward like a deadline."

"Healthy culture and structured goal setting are interdependent."



## FAQ


### Are OKRs heavyweight or lightweight?

OKRs are lightweight. This is on purpose. OKRs are deliberately created to be lightweight goal tracking, that is effective for teams of all sizes, that provide high-level summaries with ways to know progress.


### How long should I spend writing OKRs?

If you know what you're doing, in terms of your goals, your intentions for deadlines, and how you want to make progress, then writing OKRs should take you minutes. If you don't know what you're doing, or you want to communicate with more clarity among many teams, then you can spend more time honing them. 

For example, here's how one company of a hundred people does it. Each month, each team, department, and chief officer spends one hour writing OKRs, and one hour reading everyone OKRs. Typically this is all fast and easy, because all participants have a good general idea of their own work goals, deadlines, and progress points, and the participants have good ongoing communications overall. All the participants are free to edit and polish their OKRs are they wish, based on feedback from other participants and based on better understanding from other OKRs.


### How do OKRs compare to other communication approaches?

OKRs summarize each team's few most-important goals, deadlines, and progress points. OKRs are quick, fast, easy, and light, which helps all the participants.

OKRs emphasize how to measure whether a key result is accomplished, and how to measure progress on it.

OKRs are intended to be visible to all the participants, so all the teams can understand all the top few goals.

If your teams are doing these kinds of ideas above, and communicating these among your teams reguarly by other communication approaches, then generally speaking you're already doing the conceptual equivalent of OKRs. Recall that OKRs are a concept, not a specific communication protocol (such as email or chat), and not a specific kind of interface (such as a task list or work board).


### How do OKRs compare to messaging, email, or chat?

OKRs are different than team communication via messaging, email, and chat because OKRs provide always-up-to-date shared visibility and progress measurement.

For example, when a new person joins a team, then the new person can see all the OKRs, and do not need to dig through message archives, or email mailboxs, or chat channels. 

In addition, OKRs are intended to roll up, so each team can have its own OKRs, which will roll up into a department's OKRs, which will roll up into the company's OKRs; this enables participants to quickly look at different levels of resolution of goals, which is very useful for balancing priorities among teams.


### How do OKRs compare to task lists or work boards?

OKRs focus on the top few goals, deadlines, and progress points; task lists and work boards typically capture much more information, such as a total enumeration of all task items or work items.

OKRs aim to solve the problem of "how do we quickly communicate about teams' most important goals?"; task lists and work boards typically aim to solve the problem of "how do I capture every to-do item?".

Some web services are offering ways to blend OKRs with typical task lists and work boards, including ways to summarize goals, and track proress, and roll up task items and work items into the relevant OKRs. Teams can use these services to get the best of both worlds.

<h2><a name="what-is-an-okr">Introduction: What is an OKR?</a></h2>

OKRs stands for Objectives and Key Results. It is a method of defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes.

  * Its main goal is to connect company, team and personal objectives to measurable results, making people move together in the right direction.

  * A big part of OKR is making sure each individual knows what's expected of them at work.

  * OKRs are kept public in front of everyone so that teams move in one direction and know what others are focusing on.

  * OKRs were invented at Intel, and are used today by many companies, including Intel, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and Uber.

<h2><a name="objective">What is an objective?</a></h2>

Your objective is a single sentence that is:

* Qualitative

* Inspirational

  * Provide a sense of meaning and progress.

  * Skip anything such as a small percentage gain.

* Relatable

  * Use language that your team knows and likes.

  * Skip abstract language and unfamiliar acronyms.

* Timely

  * Aim for a clear sprint toward a goal, such as doable this month, or doable this quarter.

  * If it takes a year, your objective may be strategy, or maybe even a mission.

* Actionable by the team independently

  * Your Objective has to be truly yours

  * You can’t have any excuse of interdependence, such as "marketing didn’t market it."


For example, some good objectives:

  * Launch an Awesome MVP.
  * Succeed in raising Series A investment.
  * Transform San Francisco’s shopping habits.

For example, some good key results:

  * Sales numbers up 30%.
  * Raise a Series A investment of $1MM.
  * Double our userbase.


All high-performance OKR systems have these commonalities:

* The ability to track results on a quantitative basis.

  * Key results are not general or subjective actions you plan to take.

  * They should always include numbers to make it clear how much has been achieved.

  * For example, if Mary’s objective is to improve her sales prospecting skills, one key result might be to spend two hours a week shadowing Jennifer, the team member who demonstrates the most prospecting success.

* Make it something people look at, every quarter, every week, every day.

  * This consistency turns goal-setting into a habit and changes how people think about their work and approach their everyday to-dos.

  * It puts in place natural milestones that make you think about what you need to do next and aim high.

* They have to be a stretch.

  * You want your objectives to be ambitious enough to push you beyond your limits.

  * When everyone does this, it forces the tough conversations about what's truly needed to beat expectations.

  * Most people wouldn’t consider 70% to be a good grade, but for OKRs that’s just about perfect, Davis says.


<h2><a name="key-result">What is a key result?</a></h2>

Key results take the inspirational language and quantify it.

Create key results by asking a simple question “how would we know if we met our objective?”

Typically you have 1-3 key results.

Metrics can be based on:

  * Growth
  * Engagement
  * Revenue
  * Performance
  * Quality

For example, “Launch an Awesome MVP” might have KR’s of:

  * Net Promotor Score (NPS) of 8/10
  * 20% of users come back 2X in one week
  * 10% conversion
